Implementation of the popular card game Monopoly Deal

I'll be working on this project to implement one of my favorite card games : **Monopoly Deal**.

As part of this project, I'll try learning & playing with some new tech (Rust), implement some of the best development practices I've had a chance to work with (Implementing a proper CI/CD workflow), have a well built app deployed and running on AWS.

I'll be using Github to manage the features & issues that need to be implemented for developping the app. I'm going to attempt to deliver the app in an iterative way, here are some high level milestones I'll be able aiaming to get to :

- [ ] Go over Rust programming basics
- [ ] Bootsrap basic application
- [ ] Deploy app to AWS with proper CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Implement basic CLI version of game (which would allow for game to be played)
- [ ] Add rule validation & automate certain aspect of the game 
- [ ] Implement graphical version of game
- [ ] Add CPU controlled opponents
- [ ] Add online/multiplayer option
- [ ] Add option to keep game records
- [ ] Add multiple games
